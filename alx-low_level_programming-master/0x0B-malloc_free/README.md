# C - malloc, free

In this project, I learned about the difference between automatic
and dynamic location as well as how to use `malloc`, `free`, and `valgrind` in C.

## Header File :file_folder:

* [main.h](./main.h): Header file containing prototypes for all functions written
in the project.

| File               | Protoype                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `0-create_array.c` | `char *create_array(unsigned int size, char c);` |
| `1-strdup.c`       | `char *_strdup(char *str);`                      |
| `2-str_concat.c`   | `char *str_concat(char *s1, char *s2);`          |
| `3-alloc_grid.c`   | `int **alloc_grid(int width, int height);`       |
| `4-free_grid.c`    | `void free_grid(int **grid, int height);`        |
| `5-argstostr.c`    | `char *argstostr(int ac, char **av);`            |
| `100-strtow.c`     | `char **strtow(char *str);`                      |

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee**
  * [0-create_array.c](./0-create_array.c): C function that returns a pointer to a
  newly-allocated space in memory containing an array of characters.
    * The array of characters is initialized to the parameter `c`.
    * If the function fails or receives `size` equal to `0` - returns `NULL`.

* **1. The woman who has no imagination has no wings**
  * [1-strdup.c](./1-strdup.c): C function that returns a pointer to a newly-allocated space
  in memory containing a copy of the string passed as parameter.
    * Returns a pointer to a new string which is a duplicate of the string `str`.
    * Memory for the new string is obtained with `malloc` and can be freed with `free`.
    * If `str` is `NULL` or insufficient memory was available - returns `NULL`.

* **2. He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life**
  * [2-str_concat.c](./2-str_concat.c): C function that returns a pointer to a
  newly-allocated space in memory containing the concatenation of two strings passed as
  parameters.
    * The returned pointer contains the contents of `s1` followed by `s2` and is
    null-terminated.
    * The function treats `NULL` as an empty string.
    * If the function fails - returns `NULL`.

* **3. If you even dream of beating me you'd better wake up and apologize**
  * [3-alloc_grid.c](./3-alloc_grid.c): C function that returns a
  pointer to a newly-allocated space in memory containing a two-dimensional array of integers.
    * Each element of the two-dimensional array is initialized to `0`.
    * If the function fails or either of `width` or `height` is
    `0` or negative - returns `NULL`.

* **4. It's not bragging if you can back it up**
  * [4-free_grid.c](./4-free_grid.c): C function that frees a two-dimensional array previsouly
  created by the `alloc_grid` function defined in `3-alloc_grid.c`.
    * The program does not crash upon receiving invalid two-dimensional arrays.

* **5. It isn't the mountains ahead to climb that wear you out; it's the pebble in your shoe**
  * [5-argstostr.c](./5-argstostr.c): C function that returns a pointer to a
  newly-allocated space in memory containing the concatenation of all the arguments of the
  program.
    * Each argument is followed by a `\n` in the new string.
    * If `ac == 0`, `av == NULL`, or the function fails - returns `NULL`.

* **6. I will show you how great I am**
  * [100-strtow.c](./100-strtow.c): C function that splits a string into words.
    * Returns a pointer to a newly-allocated space in memory containing
    an array of strings (words).
    * Each element of the array of strings contains a single word, null-terminated.
    * The last element of the returned array is `NULL`.
    * Words are separated by spaces.
    * If `str == NULL`, `str == ""`, or the function fails - returns `NULL`.
