# Networking basics #1

This project was the second of two introducing networking. I continued to learn
about IP addresses while practicing manipulating them with Bash scripts.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **Localhost**
  * [0-localhost](./0-localhost): Text file that answers the following question:
  * What is `localhost`?
    1. A hostname that means this IP
    2. A hostname that means this computer
    3. An IP attached to a computer

* **1. All IPs**
  * [1-wildcard](./1-wildcard): Text file that answers the following question:
  * What is `0.0.0.0`?
    1. All IPv4 addresses on the local machine
    2. All the IPs
    3. It means null in networking

* **2. Change your home IP**
  * [2-change_your_home_IP](./2-change_your_home_IP): Bash script that configures
  an Ubuntu server as follows:
  * `localhost` resolves to `127.0.0.2`
  * `facebook.com` resolves to `8.8.8.8`

* **3. Show attached IPs**
  * [3-show_attached_IPs](./3-show_attached_IPs): Bash script that displays all active IPv4
  IP's on the machine.

* **4. Port listening on localhost**
  * [4-port_listening_on_localhost](./4-port_listening_on_localhost): Bash script that
  listens on port `98` on `localhost`.
