# Web infrastructure design

This was a week-long project in which I began to research web infrastructure
design. As I conducted research on different design principles, I
whiteboarded diagrams of a developing web infrastructure. I started with a
simple LAMP model and ended with a fully distributed, monitored, and secured
system.

Files in this project contain links to each respective whiteboard diagram.
