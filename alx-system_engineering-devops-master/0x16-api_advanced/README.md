# 0x16. API advanced
In this project, I practice with the [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/)'s many endpoints.  There’s a lot of endpoints available, many that don’t require any form of authentication, and there’s tons of information to be parsed out and presented.

## Learned
- How to read API documentation to find the endpoints you’re looking for
- How to use an API with pagination
- How to parse JSON results from an API
- How to make a recursive API call
- How to sort a dictionary by value
